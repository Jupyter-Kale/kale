    "### Two-way communication\n",
    "- Kale intercepts Parsl execution by overriding the Parsl DataFlowKernel\n",
    "- Kale executes tasks via Parsl\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scope\n",
    "The following is a brief demonstration of this interaction. So far, only Python functions have been implemented. I haven't yet tried to integrate bash functions or batch tasks as we have in Kale.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Passing Data in Kale\n",
    "To match the Parsl model, it was necessary to allow data to be passed from one Kale Task to another via arguments, which was not previously possible. So that's a cool new feature!\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if the output of `Kale Task A` should be an argument to `Kale Task B`, then `Kale Task A` itself should be passed as an argument, and it's result will be evaluated immediately before `Kale Task A` is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Breaking changes\n",
    "Also, I've made some changes to achieve this which have probably broken the previous Fireworks model, so some modifications will be necessary before merging to master."
